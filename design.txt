Core principles: security & efficiency
--------------------------------------

- No OS components in containers, flatpaks, snaps, or A/B partitions
- Online updates, except for core OS components
- Access to different /home subdirectories and other capabilities is controlled for all apps
- Entire boot is measured & trusted

Boot partitions
---------------

Only have one boot partition - the ESP or the traditional one - unless the ESP is too small.
Use XBOOTLDR type for the latter.
Mount each partition only when necessary: on explicit request or when updating its contents.
For any partition using vFAT: write file, syncfs(), rename file, syncfs().
For any partition using vFAT: fsck on mount.
Both partitions need to be mounted at the top (/) level.
